![main results](show.jpg)

Repository of the following research:

We analyze the free expansion of Bose-Einstein condensates containing multicharged vortices. The atomic cloud is initially confined in a three-dimensional asymmetric harmonic trap. We apply both approximate variational solutions and numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The data obtained provide a way to establish the presence as well as the multiplicity of vortices based only on the properties of the expanded cloud which can be obtained via time-of-flight measurements. In addition, several features such as the evolution of the vortex core size and the asymptotic velocity during free expansion were studied considering the atomic cloud as being released from different harmonic trap configurations.
