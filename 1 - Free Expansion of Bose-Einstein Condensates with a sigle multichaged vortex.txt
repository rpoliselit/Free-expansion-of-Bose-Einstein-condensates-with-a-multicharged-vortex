Abstract

Multi-charged vortex is a stable solution of Gross-Pitaeviskii 
equation at absence of the temperature, for the case where the 
vortex line is at the center and along the axial axis. We have 
started this work seeking for a trial function to describe our 
frame work, and through a variational method, which use the 
atomic cloud parameters as time-dependent variational parameters, 
to describe the free expansion of BEC. Thus, we have calculated 
the functional energy and the equations of motion, which these 
ones were solved by 4^{th} order Runge-Kutta method. It has shown 
great results, which are in agreemment with the experiments and 
numerical simulations, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

I. Introduction

The remarkable discovery in BEC's physics was the nucleation of 
vortices inside the Bose-Einstein condensate of Alkali atoms, 
with many experimental evidence[3v, rev3, turb, pethick, davis]. 
These vortices have quantized angular momentum by number of 
particles, and they are nucleation when the system gains a 
rotation, i.e., angular momentum. If the rotation of system 
overcomes a critical velocity of rotation, \Omega_{c}, it 
triggers the emergence of quantized vortices[critical1, vf1, vor2, pd]
. Thus the dynamics of vortex formation, the stability dynamics 
and the free expansion dynamics are the subject of several 
studies[d1v, vi1, vi2]. The vortex dynamics have proved of 
paramount importance for the understanding of the quantum 
turbulence[turb, liv3], and the free expansion is the main 
experimental method of measurement[vp, vor1, rev3, obv, MIT]. 
There are many theoretical works about vortex latices and vortex 
in rotating traps [aa, fad, obv, pethick, rev2, dsv], where the 
starting point is the Gross-Pitaeviskii equation (GPE) [gpe1, gpe2]
.

In this paper we considered a muli-charged vortex at the center 
of the condensate, which is the center of the harmonic trap. 
Here, we used the variational method to study the effects that 
arise while the free expansion of condensate, as consequence of 
non-fundamental vortices. A similar works was done by E. Lundh et 
al[emil] to the case where the vortex has only one quantum of 
circulation, which the same work can be found with quite numeric 
character in Micheli et al[michele].

The section II present the theoretical methods used in this work. 
In the section III, we have search for a suitable trial function 
and analyses this one to determine the radii of condensate. Soon 
after it, in the sections IV and V, we found the initials 
condition and the motion equations to the free expansion, and 
also take the TF-limit to the both.

Finally, the section VI has the discussions and outlooks about 
our results by the method employed.

II. Theoretical Method

At absolute zero temperature in the absense of thermal cloud the 
system is exactly described by GPE:i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}=\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V(\vec{r})+U_{0}\left|\Psi(\vec{r},t)\right|^{2}\right]\Psi(\vec{r},t).
The harmonic trap is described in cylindrical coordinates as V(\vec{r})=\frac{1}{2}m\omega_{\rho}^{2}(\rho^{2}+\lambda^{2}z^{2})
, where \lambda is the anisotropic parameter, and the constant of 
mean-field interaction is U_{0}=4\pi\hbar^{2}a_{s}/m. Following 
the variational principle we can write the Lagrangian density \mathcal{L}
 which recoves the GPE for a complex field \Psi(\vec{r},t), thus \mathcal{L}
 is writed as\begin{array}{c}
\mathcal{L}={\displaystyle \frac{i\hbar}{2}\left(\Psi^{*}(\vec{r},t)\frac{\partial\Psi(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}-\Psi(\vec{r},t)\frac{\partial\Psi^{*}(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}\right)}\\
\\{\displaystyle -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left|\nabla\Psi(\vec{r},t)\right|^{2}-V(\vec{r})\left|\Psi(\vec{r},t)\right|^{2}-\frac{U_{0}}{2}\left|\Psi(\vec{r},t)\right|^{4}}.\end{array}
Where \Psi(\vec{r},t) can be aprproximated by a trial function \Psi_{\ell}(\vec{r},t)
 which depends om a seto of variational parameters q_{i}=q_{i}(t)[perez1, perez2]
. This function can them be substituted into

L=\int\mathcal{L}d^{3}r,in such a way that their time evolution 
is given by

\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q}=0.

In that way, the next step is to find a suitable trial function.

III. Finding a trial function

In the central vortex case with multiplied charge, the wave 
functions, in cylindrical coordinates, is given by: \psi_{\ell}(\rho,\phi,z)=f_{\ell}(\rho,z)e^{i\ell\phi},
where f_{\ell}(\rho,z) is the amplitude of the wave function, and 
e^{i\ell\phi} is a phase which carries the information of the 
velocity field, where \ell is integer and means the quantum 
number of circulation. Therefore, by introducing [eq:2.1] in 
time-independent GPE we have a centrifugal term, which comes from 
phase e^{i\ell\phi}. This term is write as \left(\frac{\hbar^{2}\ell\text{\texttwosuperior}}{2m\rho^{r}}\right)f
. To find a suitable ansatz for multi-charged vortex, we 
considered the interval of \rho\ll\xi, and we have neglected 
potential terms from GPE. By considering only kinetic terms with 
the additional centrifugal term, we need to solve-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left[\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial}{\partial\rho}\left(\rho\frac{\partial f}{\partial\rho}\right)\right]+\frac{\hbar^{2}\ell^{2}}{2m\rho^{2}}f=0,
this equation give us the solution for f(\rho) when this is 
smaller than cloud, which means the vortex solution. For \rho>\xi
, we considered the solution of GPE without interaction 
potential, the ideal gas solution, thus our amplitude f(\rho,z) 
isf_{\ell}(\rho,z)=\left[\frac{N}{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}\ell!R_{\rho}^{2\ell+2}R_{z}}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\rho^{\ell}\exp\left(-\frac{\rho^{2}}{2R_{\rho}^{2}}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{z^{2}}{2R_{z}^{2}}\right),
and now, the trial function is given by:\Psi_{\ell}(\rho,\phi,z,t)=\psi_{\ell}(\rho,\phi,z)\exp\left(iB_{\rho}\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}\right)\exp\left(iB_{z}\frac{z^{2}}{2}\right).
Where the parameters R_{\rho}, R_{z}, B_{\rho} and B_{z} are 
time-dependent.

If \ell=0, we recover the solution for a condensate without 
vortex of V.M. Pérez-García et al[perez1]. Thus, the ansatz 
describe since a fundamental condensate until condensates with 
multi-charged vortex at the center of the atomic cloud. Note 
this: the parameters B_{\rho} and B_{z} are responsible for the 
function curvature, in other words, it is from these parameters 
that will appears the acceleration in motion equation by the 
variational method. We must take care with parameters R_{\rho} 
and R_{z}, because they are not the radii of our condensate for 
every values of \ell. In the case, where \ell is zero, R_{\rho} 
and R_{z} are the radii in fact, but when we have \ell>0, the 
parameter R_{\rho} is the width of Gaussian at least a scale 
factor, and the peak of that is in the point R_{\rho}\sqrt{\ell}. 
It´s occurs due the absence of a parameter which separate these 
two information, radius of vortex core and radius of the 
condensate. Thereby, absence of these two parameters, we have all 
of information about vortex core and cloud radius in the only one 
parameter, R_{\rho}. For that reason, we will define the radius 
as:\begin{array}{c}
R_{\bot}^{(\ell)}(t)=\sqrt{\left\langle \rho^{2}\right\rangle }=R_{\rho}^{(\ell)}(t)\sqrt{\ell+1}\\
\\R_{||}^{(\ell)}(t)=R_{z}^{(\ell)}(t).\end{array}
The \ell, above of R, is the index about what case we are 
referring, i.e., what kind of condensate within circulation. And 
the vortex core, \xi, may be defined as: the healing length of a 
condensate without vortex calculated at center of density, i.e.,\xi^{(\ell)}=\ell\hbar\pi^{\frac{3}{4}}R_{\rho}^{(\ell)}\sqrt{\frac{R_{z}^{(\ell)}}{2mNU_{0}}},
using the parameters, R_{\rho} and R_{z}, of them respective 
number of circulation.

Now we substited [eq:2.4]in [eq:1.2] and integrate its ovar all 
space therefore the Lagrangian isL=N\hbar\omega_{\rho}\left\{ \frac{\left(\ell+1\right)}{2}\left[\frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{2}}+\left(\dot{\beta}_{\rho}+\beta_{\rho}^{2}+1\right)r_{\rho}^{2}\right]+\frac{1}{4}\left[\frac{1}{r_{z}^{2}}+\left(\dot{\beta}_{z}+\beta_{z}^{2}+\lambda^{2}\right)r_{z}^{2}\right]+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}}\right\} ,
where varational parameters were scaled as R_{\rho}(t)=a_{osc}r_{\rho}(t)
, R_{z}(t)=a_{osc}r_{z}(t), B_{\rho}(t)=a_{osc}^{-2}\beta_{\rho}(t)
 and B_{z}(t)=a_{osc}^{-2}\beta_{z}(t), with the harmonic 
oscilator length being a_{osc}=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_{\rho}}. And 
the intecation parameter becomes dimensionless being write as \gamma=Na_{s}/a_{osc}
. The equation of motion are extracted from [eq:2.8] using [eq:1.4]
 thus these are given by:\begin{array}{c}
{\displaystyle \left(\dot{\beta}_{\rho}+\beta_{\rho}^{2}+1\right)r_{\rho}=\frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{3}}+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell+1\right)!\ell!r_{\rho}^{3}r_{z}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle \beta_{\rho}=\frac{\dot{r_{\rho}}}{r_{\rho}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle \left(\dot{\beta}_{z}+\beta_{z}^{2}+\lambda^{2}\right)r_{z}=\frac{1}{r_{z}^{3}}+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}^{2}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle \beta_{z}=\frac{\dot{r_{z}}}{r_{z}}}.\end{array}

These four equations can be reduced to only two, which are:\begin{array}{c}
{\displaystyle \ddot{r_{\rho}}+r_{\rho}=\frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{3}}+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell+1\right)!\ell!r_{\rho}^{3}r_{z}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle \ddot{r_{z}}+\lambda^{2}r_{z}=\frac{1}{r_{z}^{3}}+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}^{2}}}.\end{array}

IV. Stationary case

By calculate the functional energy using [eq:2.1] we obtain each 
contribution which the circulation carries. Thus, the energy of 
condensate with \ell quanta of circulation is: E_{\ell}=N\hbar\omega_{\rho}\left[\frac{\left(\ell+1\right)}{2}\left(\frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{2}}+r_{\rho}^{2}\right)+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{r_{z}^{2}}+\lambda^{2}r_{z}^{2}\right)+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}}\right],
where \Gamma is the Gamma Function. Looking at the kinetic terms, 
proportional to r_{\rho}^{-2} and r_{z}^{-2}, we may observe the 
kinetic energy increase linearity with circulation. The same 
behavior happens with energy from the harmonic potential, r_{\rho}^{2}
 and r_{z}^{2}. Although, the interaction energy has a distinct 
behavior, this contribution in the energy of condensate is lower 
while \ell increases, i.e, the interaction energy decreases 
asymptotically as a function of \ell, and goes to zero in the 
limit of the high circulation or big vortex. Through the 
minimization of [eq:3.1] in respect by the parameters r_{\rho} 
and r_{z}, we obtain the stationary solution for the trapped 
condensate, this procedure is equivalent to turns zero the 
acceleration and velocity in [eq:2.10]. Hence, it results in two 
coupled equations which are:

\begin{array}{c}
{\displaystyle r_{\rho0}^{4}=1+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}(\ell+1)!\ell!r_{z0}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle \lambda^{2}r_{z0}^{4}=1+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!r_{z0}}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}(\ell!)^{2}r_{\rho0}^{2}}.}\end{array}

Here, we might validate the limits of trapped conditions, so: if \ell
 value 0 or 1, the limit of Thomas-Fermi regime may be describe 
taking large \gamma. This is equivalent we neglect the kinetic 
term in both equations [eq:3.2]. Thus the equations [eq:3.2] 
turns:\begin{array}{c}
{\displaystyle r_{\rho0}=\left(\ell+1\right)^{-\frac{3}{10}}\left[\frac{\gamma\lambda(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}}\right]^{\frac{1}{5}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle r_{z0}=\left[\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}\lambda^{2}}\right]^{\frac{1}{3}}}.\end{array}
Now, the case where \ell\geq2, the kinetic term is the order of 
the interaction term to the r_{\rho0} equation at [eq:3.2]. 
Therefore, the r_{\rho0} equation keeps the same one in the 
Thomas-Fermi regime, for as much as, the r_{z0} equation have the 
kinetic term neglected, then [eq:3.2] becomes:\begin{array}{c}
{\displaystyle r_{\rho0}^{4}=1+\left(\ell+1\right)^{-3}\left[\frac{\gamma\lambda(2\ell)!r_{\rho}}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}}\right]^{\frac{2}{3}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle {\displaystyle r_{z0}=\left[\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}\lambda^{2}}\right]^{\frac{1}{3}}}.}\end{array}

V. Free expansion

The free expansion equations are obtained when the trap term from 
[eq:2.10] is threw out, and thus they are changed to

\begin{array}{c}
{\displaystyle \ddot{r_{\rho}}=\frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{3}}+\frac{(2\ell)!\gamma}{2^{2\ell-1}\left(2\pi\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}(\ell+1)!\ell!r_{\rho}^{3}r_{z}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle \ddot{r_{z}}=\frac{1}{r_{z}^{3}}+\frac{(2\ell)!\gamma}{2^{2\ell-1}\left(2\pi\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}(\ell)!^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}^{2}}}.\end{array}

It´ve already known that the asymptotical behavior of expansion´s 
rate is justified by the interaction term is greater than 
kinetic, thus the kinetic term just affects its beahivor in a 
short time, i.e., at the first miliseconds. After it the other 
term dominate. Although when \ell becomes large enough that it 
makes the interaction terms goes to zero. Therefore the equations 
[eq:4.2] will just have the kinetic terms, which is the same caso 
of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the limit of ideal gas. Thus the 
free expansion equations becomes\begin{array}{c}
{\displaystyle \ddot{r_{\rho}}=\frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{3}}}\\
\\{\displaystyle \ddot{r_{z}}=\frac{1}{r_{z}^{3}}},\end{array}
and the initial conditions in that case are r_{\rho}(0)=r_{\rho0}=1
 and r_{z}(0)=r_{z0}=\lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}. Solving them we haver_{j}(\tau)=\sqrt{r_{j}(0)^{2}+r_{j}(0)^{-2}\tau^{2}},
where j=\rho,z. This last result is also similar to 2D case which 
was done in [emil], nevertheless they have solved carrying the 
intection term at \rho direction.

The method used gives us good results, where we have calculated 
the initial conditions to the free expansion through [eq:3.2] by 
Newton's method, and solved the equations[eq:4.2] by fourth-order 
Runge-Kutta to flying time of the order of 30ms. Furthermore, all 
of this graphic are to \omega_{\rho}/2\pi=207Hz and \gamma=800, 
because these values are the laboratory data from our 
experimental group.

The approach [eq:2.6] proved to be usable for \ell=1, which the 
case has the same energy when compared with the energy of \ell=0. 
By checking \xi^{(\ell)} for \ell>1, it was expected that \xi^{(\ell)}
 was multiple of \xi^{(1)} as it is known from literature[pethick, aa]
, i.e., \xi^{(\ell)}=\ell\xi^{(1)}. Although the result was \xi^{(\ell)}<\ell\xi^{(1)}
, in which case is justified by the Figures 2 and 3, where we may 
be observed the energy of a condensate with fundamental vortex is 
the same of a condensate without vortex. Thus, the vortex core is 
of the order of the healing length (condensate without vortex) in 
the limit of Thomas-Fermi regime (Figure 1). Therefore, the ratio 
\xi/R_{\bot} while expansion just could be done for \ell=1 
(Figure 4 (d)) such that agree qualitatively with numerical 
results by F. Dalforo and M. Modugno[michele], and becomes better 
when \gamma\gg20 as shown in the Figure 1.

In the expansion (Figure 4), we compared the time to aspect ratio 
inversion for \ell=0 between this method and the data from 
experiments (\omega_{\rho}=2\pi207Hz, \lambda\thickapprox0.1 and \gamma\thickapprox800
), which resulted as a great crosscheck that is around 8ms.

Hence, as results, the vortex adds more kinetic energy and 
decrease the interaction energy, which makes that condensate 
expand faster in the orthogonal direction at the vortex's 
orientation. Furthermore, it expands faster and faster to 
vortices with larger charge. Thus, the inversion of the aspect 
ratio is faster when the trap shape is prolate , and it slower 
when the condensate started the free expansion from a oblate trap 
- as it has more charge on the vortex. As known, the most 
confined direction of the condensate expands faster, such that: 
to the spherical shape (\lambda=1), the expansion is equal in 
both direction unless \ell>0. Consequently, the vortex adds 
expansion's speed, however, it is not enough to cause reversal in 
aspect ratio. Once the condensate containing the vortex is 
slightly flatted at the poles.
