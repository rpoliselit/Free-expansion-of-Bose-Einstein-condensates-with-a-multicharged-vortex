\begin_layout Abstract
In this work, we analyse the free expansion of Bose-Einstein condensates
 containing multi-charged vortices.
 The atomic cloud is initially confined in a three-dimensional asymetric
 harmonic trap.
 We employ both approximate variational solutions and numerical simulations
 of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
 The data obtained provide a way to determine the presence as well as the
 multiplicity of vortices based only on the properties of the expanded cloud
 which can be obtained via time-of-flight measurements.
 In addition, several features like the evolution of the vortex core size
 and the asymptotic velocity during free expansion were studied considering
 the atomic cloud as being released from different harmonic trap configurations.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extension of quantum phenomena into macroscopic scales is responsible
 for a whole class of effects such as superconductivity, superfluidity,
 and Bose-Einstein Condensation, which played central roles in the last-century
 physics.
 The production of the first Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), using rubidium

 and sodium 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 atoms, turned possible the realization of experiments involving macroscopic
 quantum phenomena with unprecedented level of control of the external parameter
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vortices in BECs are topological defects characterized by a quantized angular
 momentum.
 A conventional method for generation of such defects consists in confining
 the condensed atomic cloud into a rotating trap.
 It turns out that, for angular velocities higher than a critical value
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{c}$
\end_inset

, vortex states become energetically favorable, thus inducing the creation
 of quantized vortices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "critical1,vf1,vor2,pd"

\end_inset

.
 Experimental realizations of condensed alkali atoms confined by more general
 time-dependent potentials allowed the observation not only of vortex lattices
 but also of quantum turbulence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "3v,rev3,turb,pethick,davis"

\end_inset

.
 Since quantum turbulence is characterized by the presence of a self-interacting
 tangle of quantized vortices, the correct understanding of dynamics, formation,
 and stability of vortices have shown to be of paramount importance

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The radius of vortex cores are tipicaly of the order of the healing length
 of the condensate.
 Such a small size makes

 observations very dificult.
 The most common method for visualization of vortices in BECs relies on
 the so called time-flight pictures which can be obtained after releasing
 the condensed cloud from its trap and letting it expand freelly for some
 time, typically tens of miliseconds 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vp,vor1,rev3,obv,MIT"

\end_inset

.
 To determine the charge multiplicity of of vortices in confined clouds
 using time-of-flight pictures, it is necessary to stabilish the correct
 conection between the characteristics of the trapped and expanded clouds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we considered the expansion of a BEC containing a multiply
 charged vortex at its center.
 The main calculations are performed by using a variational method which
 takes into account the presence of non-fundamental vortices.

 was done by Lundh

\begin_layout Standard
The section II present the theoretical methods used in this work.
 In the section III, we have search for a suitable trial function and analyses
 this one to determine the radii of condensate.
 Soon after it, in the sections IV and V, we found the initials condition
 and the motion equations to the free expansion, and also take the TF-limit
 to the both.

Variational Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At zero temperature, a Bose gas with scattering length 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{s}$
\end_inset

 much smaller than the average interparticle distance can be described by
 the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}=\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V(\mathbf{r})+U_{0}\left|\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\right|^{2}\right]\Psi(\mathbf{r},t),\label{eq:1.1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with the harmonic trap given in cylindrical coordinates given by 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{2}m\omega_{\rho}^{2}(\rho^{2}+\lambda^{2}z^{2})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the mass of the particles, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is an anisotropy parameter, and the coupling constant is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{0}=4\pi\hbar^{2}a_{s}/m$
\end_inset

.
 Following the variational principle, the Lagrangian density 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 which recovers the GPE for a complex field 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\mathcal{L}={\displaystyle \frac{i\hbar}{2}\left(\Psi^{*}(\mathbf{r},t)\frac{\partial\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}-\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\frac{\partial\Psi^{*}(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}\right)}\\
{\displaystyle -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left|\nabla\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\right|^{2}-V(\mathbf{r})\left|\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\right|^{2}-\frac{U_{0}}{2}\left|\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\right|^{4}}.
\end{array}\label{eq:1.2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the variational method, the wave funcion 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$
\end_inset

 of a condensate containing one central vortex with charge 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is approximated by a trial function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\ell}(\mathbf{r},t)$
\end_inset

 which depends on a set of variational parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}=q_{i}(t)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "perez1,perez2"

\end_inset

.
 This function can then be substituted into Lagrange function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L=\int\mathcal{L}d^{3}\mathbf{r}.\label{eq:1.3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This way, the time evolution of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 follows the Euler-Lagrange equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_{i}}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}=0.\label{eq:1.4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, we generalize the trial function in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "emil"

\end_inset

 to the case of three-dimensional BECs with multiply charged vortices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\ell}(\rho,\phi,z,t)=\left[\frac{N}{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}\ell!R_{\rho}(t)^{2\ell+2}R_{z}(t)}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\rho^{\ell}e^{i\ell\phi}\psi_{G}(\rho,z,t)e^{iB_{\rho}(t)\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}+iB_{z}(t)\frac{z^{2}}{2}},\label{eq:2.3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{G}$
\end_inset

 being given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\psi_{G}(\rho,z,t)=\exp\left(-\frac{\rho^{2}}{2R_{\rho}(t)^{2}}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{z^{2}}{2R_{z}(t)^{2}}\right).\label{eq:2.4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell=0$
\end_inset

, we recover the vortex-free approximation proposed by Pérez-García

.
 In our case, however, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 is no longer the mean square root of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Instead, it is related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left\langle \rho^{2}\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

 according to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\left\langle \rho^{2}\right\rangle }=\sqrt{\ell+1}R_{\rho}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we define the vortex core 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 as the healing length calculated at the center of the condensate disconsidering
 the presence of a central vortex.
 It leads us to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\xi=\ell\hbar\pi^{\frac{3}{4}}R_{\rho}\sqrt{\frac{R_{z}}{2mNU_{0}}}.\label{eq:2.6}

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for the variational parameters 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L=-N\hbar\omega_{\rho}\left\{ \frac{\left(\ell+1\right)}{2}\left[\frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{2}}+\left(\dot{\beta}_{\rho}+\beta_{\rho}^{2}+1\right)r_{\rho}^{2}\right]+\frac{1}{4}\left[\frac{1}{r_{z}^{2}}+\left(\dot{\beta}_{z}+\beta_{z}^{2}+\lambda^{2}\right)r_{z}^{2}\right]+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}}\right\} ,\label{eq:2.8}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the variational parameters were scaled according to 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\rho}(t)=a_{osc}r_{\rho}(t)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{z}(t)=a_{osc}r_{z}(t)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $B_{\rho}(t)=a_{osc}^{-2}\beta_{\rho}(t)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $B_{z}(t)=a_{osc}^{-2}\beta_{z}(t)$
\end_inset

 The harmonic oscilator length was defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{osc}=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_{\rho}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=Na_{s}/a_{osc}$
\end_inset

 applied to the Langrangean 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 finally lead us to the equations of motion
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left(\dot{\beta}_{\rho}+\beta_{\rho}^{2}+1\right)r_{\rho}= & \frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{3}}+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell+1\right)!\ell!r_{\rho}^{3}r_{z}},\label{eq:2.9a}\\
\beta_{\rho}= & {\displaystyle \frac{\dot{r_{\rho}}}{r_{\rho}}},\label{eq:2.9b}\\
\left(\dot{\beta}_{z}+\beta_{z}^{2}+\lambda^{2}\right)r_{z}= & \frac{1}{r_{z}^{3}}+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}^{2}},\label{eq:2.9c}\\
\beta_{z}= & {\displaystyle \frac{\dot{r_{z}}}{r_{z}}}.\label{eq:2.9d}
\end{align}

\end_inset

By taking the time-derivative of Eqs.
 (

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{z}$
\end_inset

 can be eliminated in such a way that these four equations can be reduced
 to the following two:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\ddot{r_{\rho}}+r_{\rho}= & \frac{1}{r_{\rho}^{3}}+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell+1\right)!\ell!r_{\rho}^{3}r_{z}},\label{eq:2.10a}\\
\ddot{r_{z}}+\lambda^{2}r_{z}= & \frac{1}{r_{z}^{3}}+\frac{\gamma(2\ell)!}{2^{2\ell-1}\sqrt{2\pi}\left(\ell!\right)^{2}r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}^{2}}.\label{eq:2.10b}

 of the expansion.
 This is however not the case when we consider extremely large values of

 In this case, the interaction terms can be neglected thus leading to equations
 identical to the ones describing the free expansion of an ideal gas

The method used gives us good results, where we have calculated the initial
 conditions to the free expansion through 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 by Newton's method, and solved the equations
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 by fourth-order Runge-Kutta to flying time of the order of 30ms.
 Furthermore, all of this graphic are to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\rho}/2\pi=207Hz$

The approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2.6"

\end_inset

 proved to be usable for 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell=1$
\end_inset

, which the case has the same energy when compared with the energy of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell=0$
\end_inset

.
 By checking 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi^{(\ell)}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell>1$
\end_inset

, it was expected that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi^{(\ell)}$
\end_inset

 was multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 as it is known from literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pethick,aa"

\end_inset

, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi^{(\ell)}=\ell\xi^{(1)}$
\end_inset

.
 Although the result was 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi^{(\ell)}<\ell\xi^{(1)}$
\end_inset

, in which case is justified by we may be observed the energy of a condensate
 with fundamental vortex is the same of a condensate without vortex.
 Thus, the vortex core is of the order of the healing length (condensate
 without vortex) in the limit of Thomas-Fermi regime (Figure 1).
 Therefore, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi/R_{\bot}$
\end_inset

 while expansion just could be done for 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell=1$
\end_inset

 (Figure 4 (d)) such that agree qualitatively with numerical results by
 F.
 Dalforo and M.

, and becomes better when 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\gg20$
\end_inset

 as shown in the Figure 1.
 This results could be better if we add the core size parameter in the trial
 function which greatly complicates the equations.

In the expansion (Figure 4), we compared the time to aspect ratio inversion
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell=0$
\end_inset

 between this method and the data from experiments (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\rho}=2\pi207Hz$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\thickapprox0.1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\thickapprox800$
\end_inset

), which resulted as a great crosscheck that is around 8ms.

Hence, as results, the vortex adds more kinetic energy and decrease the
 interaction energy, which makes that condensate expand faster in the orthogonal
 direction at the vortex's orientation.
 Furthermore, it expands faster and faster to vortices with larger charge.
 Thus, the inversion of the aspect ratio is faster when the trap shape is
 prolate, and it slower when the condensate started the free expansion from
 a oblate trap - as it has more charge on the vortex.
 Which these can be explain by we are keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 fixed and varing 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 As known, the most confined direction of the condensate expands faster,
 such that: to the spherical shape (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

), the expansion is equal in both direction unless 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell>0$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, the vortex adds expansion's speed, however, it is not enough
 to cause reversal in aspect ratio.
 Once the condensate containing the vortex is slightly flatted at the poles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The factor which have more influence in the aspect ratio inversion is the
 kinetic potencial, this one has its importance at short times.
 Thus its explan the faster aspect ratio inversion for 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell>0$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.1$
\end_inset

, and for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=10$
\end_inset

 the slower invesion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell=0$
\end_inset

 is caused by the axial direction be most confined and containg more quantum
 presure than other direction even though the vortex contributes with centrifuga
l energy at this othogonal direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Thinking about the experimental problems in mensuring the time of aspect
 ratio inversion at oblate shape of potencial (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>1$
\end_inset

), i.e., the range of these times are shortly and reach them assymptotical
 expansion too fast.
 Thus we have calculated the assymptotical expansion velocities for the
 both direction (
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\bot}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{||}$
\end_inset

), which can be used to verify the Figure 1 (b) behavior by the Figure 2

 A disadvantage of this method is the constraint

 between the vortex core and the cloud dimensions, which is valid for static
 configurations, is considered to be also valid during the entire expansion

 At least in principle, our Ansatz can be improved by introducing an additional
 parameter which characterizes the core expansion independently.

(a)--(c), the time evolution of the aspect ratio for different trap configuratio

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

(c) shows how the growth of the dimensions of the cloud during the expansion
 are influentiated by the circulation of the central vortex.
 The higher the circulation of these vortices, the greater is the anisoproty
 introduced in the could shape.
 This effect is further increased during the cloud expansion.

In prolate condensates, Fig.

 shows that the circulation has the effect of decreasing the time for the
 aspect ratio invertion due to the larger velocity field in the plane perpendicu
lar to the vortex line before the expansion.
 In the oposite case, where the initial geometry is oblate, as in Fig.

In this work, the expansion of the vortex core is analyzed by evolving both
 the radial and axial radius using eqs.

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, and then calculating the radius 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 of the vortex according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2.6"

\end_inset

 By taking the asymptotic solutions of eqs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:4.2a"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

, it was also possible to extract the asymptotic expansion velocities along
 the radial and axial directions, as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 These information supply a method for determining the presence as well
 as the circulation of central vortice in an asymetric cloud by simply looking
 at the asymptotic expansion velocities, which would require the repetion
 of the experiment considering different expansion time.
 An alternative method would rely on dependence of the expansion dinamics
 on the circulation
